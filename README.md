# Let me autocast
# auto-heal
tera-proxy module that skips lockons and instantly heals and cleanses party members.

## Info
- Skills will instantly lockon and heal/cleanse party members. Heals prioritize the lowest HP.
- Mystic's cleanse only works in parties of 5 members or less. Disabled in raids.
- Auto-casting can be disabled (Skills will pre-lockon onto targets and need to be manually pressed again to cast).

| Skills affected                 |

| Priest - Focus Heal             |
| Priest - Healing Immersion      |
| Mystic - Titanic Favor          |
| Mystic - Arun's Cleansing Touch |

## Issues
- Skills can ghost if proxy is also using Skill-Prediction (You see animation but nothing happens). Workaround is to disable the skills in SP. [Click here to see how](https://i.imgur.com/bS4VkbX.png)
